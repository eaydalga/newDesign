variant_and

(PHP 5)

variant_and â€” performs a bitwise AND operation between two variants and returns the result
Description
mixed variant_and ( mixed $left , mixed $right )

Performs a bitwise AND operation, according to the following truth table; note that this is slightly different from a regular AND operation.
Variant AND Rules If left is 	If right is 	then the result is
TRUE	TRUE	TRUE
TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
TRUE	NULL	NULL
FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
FALSE	NULL	FALSE
NULL	TRUE	NULL
NULL	FALSE	FALSE
NULL	NULL	NULL

See also variant_or().

    Note: As with all the variant arithmetic functions, the parameters for this function can be either a PHP native type (integer, string, floating point, boolean or NULL), or an instance of a COM, VARIANT or DOTNET class. PHP native types will be converted to variants using the same rules as found in the constructor for the VARIANT class. COM and DOTNET objects will have the value of their default property taken and used as the variant value.
    The variant arithmetic functions are wrappers around the similarly named functions in the COM library; for more information on these functions, consult the MSDN library. The PHP functions are named slightly differently; for example variant_add() in PHP corresponds to VarAdd() in the MSDN documentation.
