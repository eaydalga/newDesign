scan997 is a basic program to verify the contents of a 997 file.
All validation information is hardcoded in the program.  Normally this information 
would be loaded from a database/file dynamically.  To build scan997, run:

cc scan997.c -ledival -o scan997

If you have built edival (required) but not done a "make install" run

cc scan997.c -I../include -L../lib -ledival -o scan997 -lm


scan837 is the same as scan997, except can be used to scan 837 health claims.
