0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Schedule
       update - interactive message (SKDUPD) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message containing information about travel service
       schedules. This message is sent by a travel service provider to
       other service providers or to agencies such as government
       departments, traffic authorities, and timetable publishing
       companies.

1.2    Field of application

       The Schedule update - interactive message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       - The message is designed to transmit new or changed schedule
       information in order to update the recipient's system.
       
       - The message can contain either a complete set of schedule
       information data, either updates to a former delivery.
       
       - The message may also be used to formulate a request for re-
       transmission of the data in case of error. The message may be
       sent spontaneously, when the travel service provider has new
       information available, or as a response to a SKDREQ - Schedule
       request - interactive message.
