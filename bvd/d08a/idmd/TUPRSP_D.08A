1.1    Functional definition

       An interactive Travel, tourism and leisure data update response
       is sent by a global distribution system (GDS) to respond to a
       TUPREQ that was sent by a supplier to update rates,
       availability, or general or policy information.  It may also be
       sent by a supplier to respond to a TUPREQ message sent by a GDS
       to update a traveller’s profile.

1.2    Field of application

       The Travel, tourism and leisure data update response -

       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       TUPRSP incorporates the functionality to respond to a data base
       request in the following ways:
        
       (1)  Acknowledge that the update(s) was processed successfully.
       
       (2)  Acknowledge that some of the update(s) were processed
       successfully and list those that were not processed by an item
       or identification number that was assigned by the supplier to
       each update.
       
       (3)  Acknowledge that some of the update(s) were processed
       successfully and return all the update information for those
       that were not processed.
